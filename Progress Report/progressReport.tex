\section{Project Recap}
Our project seeks to improve and build upon vrok.it increasing the usability while simetaneously integrating a couple more functionality using Forge APIs. The end product will be capable of uploading CAD files via local user files or through Data Management’s A360, displaying the files as models through the File Viewer, file conversion with the Model Derivative, viewing the site on a mobile device via QR scanner and then viewing the site, specifically models, in VR with Google Cardboard.
\section{Current Progress}
All documentation has been taken care of. All we have to do now is to begin building it! We have all the documentation from Forge on how to integrate the various API and have the source code for Vrok.it.
\section{Problems and Solutions}
Client meetings weren’t necessarily a problem overall. However, the client pulled in some additional people leading to extra time meeting being taken to get everyone on the same page. Furthermore, with the busy schedule of the Autodesk members involved with an education event. We had a couple weeks where communication was sparse. As a result, it took a while before our requirements document was refined properly and it was a while after the deadline. In the final week though after it went through grading it turned out we missed adding grading metrics to the requirements document, should be an easy fix though. 


It was also around the same time of this two week period with low communication that one of our members fell ill and also communication was at a low from them as well. This lead to them having low contribution for that time period. This was resolved with a meeting where these problems were brought up and things were talked out.

This document was written to provide software development projects with
a template for generating a System and Software Requirements
Specification (SSRS). \ This document is based on a template originally
written by the U.S. Navy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation
Division in June 1997 in accordance with the MIL-STD-498 DID
(DI-IPSC-81433). \ The template was updated by the University of
Idaho{\textquoteright}s Center for Secure and Dependable Systems (CSDS)
in June 2008 to adhere to IEEE Std. 830-1998, \textit{IEEE Recommended
Practice for Software Requirements

Abstract
\par}

{\centering\selectlanguage{english}\mdseries\color{black}
Group 20 s project branches from an Autodesk prototype project called Vrok It, which is a simple web-based 3D model viewer and mobile virtual reality (VR) explorer. Group 20 s project will expand upon its ability to display uploaded 3D models in browser and in VR, and improve its accessibility. Conventionally, viewing 3D models in VR is a challenge if you have model files on many devices, or have a headset that only works in conjunction with a smartphone. Group 20 s project aims to do this by utilizing a web-based software that uses the features of the Autodesk Forge API. The project will also be expanded with new ideas and stretch goals as the project is developed.

Introduction}

\foreignlanguage{english}{\textit{}}\foreignlanguage{english}{ \ }
{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
The system being developed is intended to be a place in which users with CAD files can go and easily view those files in both a 3D and VR setting. This provides a solution to those who don't have access to expensive CAD programs or fancy VR headsets as it will be a free to use web services that is usable with entry level VR equipment. The intended user for this project is a person that would likely not experienced with CAD software and would not have access to software that supports CAD files.  }


\subsection[SCOPE]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
SCOPE}
{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
The scope of this project includes developing new software solutions over the course of roughly 3 months. This software should allow for the upload of a 3D model file to be viewed in (browser?) and then also into a VR environment. Having a platform that allows for simple 3D viewing on screen into an transition to VR would allow many to have access to such functionality. }

\subsection[DEFINITIONS, ACRONYMS, AND
ABBREVIATIONS]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
DEFINITIONS, ACRONYMS, AND ABBREVIATIONS}
{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
	CAD: Computer Aided design is software used to design and view 3D models.
}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
	CAD file: The type of files that can be uploaded to the website for viewing in the large model viewer.
	We will  narrow down what types of files can be used as we progress through the development process.
}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
	FORGE: A collection of CAD API services provided by Autodesk.

\subsection[PRODUCT
PERSPECTIVE]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE}
{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
The product would be building off the Vrok-It platform that has already been created. We would adding features to the product that will enhance the overall usability of the current system.    }

\subsection[PRODUCT
FUNCTIONS]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
PRODUCT FUNCTIONS}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
1.	The user is able to pick from a list of 3D models or upload one of their own CAD files.

2.	once a model is chosen or a file is uploaded the 3D models will be seen in the large model viewer at the 
	center of the website.

3.	"Viewable" 3D models can be interacted with by the user in the large model viewer in multiple ways.

4.	The user will have the ability to connect a smartphone to the website through the use of a QR scanner
	and web servers. 

5.	Once connected to a smartphone, the current model should be able to be viewed in VR with a the use
	of a VR headset such as Google Cardboard. 
}

\subsection[USER
CHARACTERISTICS]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
USER CHARACTERISTICS}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
When finished this product should be usable by anyone that has access to a CAD file. If the user is want to use the VR 
portion of the website then they will need access to some VR headset. If the user does have access to a VR headset they 
should not need any extra Knowledge other than how to use the headset.  }

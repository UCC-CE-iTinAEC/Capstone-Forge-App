## Synopsis

The Forge VR Explorer is a web-based application capable of viewing 3D models in VR. At its core, the project makes use of Forge, a web-based API collection for working with and viewing 3D models, and leverages work previously published on Kean Walmsley's blog. It has a Node.js back-end, with Socket.io handling the communication between presenter and participants.

## Installation/Usage

The project is hosted on [Heroku](https://murmuring-cove-16220.herokuapp.com/) with instructions on the page. If you have a Google Cardboard headset and a fairly modern Android device, you may choose to view the selected model in stereoscopic. User models can be uploaded through the interface at the bottom of the page or through the panel/UI on the left side of the app.

## Documentation

All documentation for the project is contained within the "Project Documents" directory in this repo. Supplementary documentation provided by [Autodesk](https://developer.autodesk.com/).
